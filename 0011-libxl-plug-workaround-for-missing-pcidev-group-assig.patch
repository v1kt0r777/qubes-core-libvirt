    vtd/iommu: permit group devices to passthrough in relaxed mode

    Currently we don't allow passing through any group devices which are
    sharing same RMRR entry since it would break security among VMs. And
    indeed, we expect we can figure out a better way to handle this kind
    of case completely.

    But before the group assignment gets implemented, we might make this
    permission dependent on our RMRR policy. So, now it would be allowed
    in the relaxed mode.

nostrictreset isn't the best place to put such workaround, but it is
similar in consequences (weaken PCI passthrough).
